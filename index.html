    <p> <em> Note: I do not use an alarm, and <a hrec = "https://fortune.com/2024/11/18/why-you-feel-better-waking-up-naturally-vs-alarm-neurologist-explains/">neither should you.</a>
    but if you get to bed at the same time you'll wake up roughly the same time. In reality I mostly base my routine on a "minutes since I woke up" manner. So my goal is to be in reading hall
within 15 min of waking up and getting 45 min of DW done before breakfast, etc</em></p>
